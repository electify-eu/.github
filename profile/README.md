# eurparl.ai: informed choices for the European elections 2024

# The problem: voters are overwhelmed
he challenge facing voters is significant. Elections for the European Parliament are held only every five years, and the European Union (EU), with its intricate structures and processes, often feels distant and complex to the average citizen. This perceived remoteness can lead to the misconception that the EU plays a minor role in the daily lives of its people. However, this is far from the truth. Many decisions that directly impact the lives of EU citizens are made at the European level and then implemented as national law across member states.

# How it works
We provide a streamlit app, where voters can ask their questions and will receive a summary of the parties position.  We are on a mission to enhance the democratic process by developing an innovative application that uses AI. Just ask your question or enter a keyword in our europarl.ai interface, and our model will summarize the positions of the parties based on your input.

In the background, we use a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) engine that has access to thousands of political documents. Our algorithm searches for the documents most relevant to your input. With this information, an AI language model then generates concise summaries for the six biggest parties in Germany.

# Description
This is our final project for the Data Science Retreat, a boocamp in Berlin. We are on a mission to enhance the democratic process within the European Union by developing an innovative chatbot application. This application will be powered by a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system, which will be meticulously fed with comprehensive data from EU election programs and the speeches of politicians throughout the preceding legislative period. The core of our system is a Large Language Model (LLM) to analyze and synthesize the nuances of EU policies and political party stances. By integrating the LLM with our RAG system, we enable the chatbot to process voter inquiries.

Voters will have the opportunity to engage in a dialogue with our chatbot, posing questions and expressing concerns about various EU policy domains. In response, our chatbot will provide informed, data-driven insights into the collective positions of the EU political landscape. This conversational interface is designed to be intuitive, allowing for a seamless flow of information that empowers voters to make well-informed decisions at the polls.

# Objective
